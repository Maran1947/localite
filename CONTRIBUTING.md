# Localite Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to improve Localite! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b <branch_name>`).
3. Make your changes and commit them using Localite commands (`localite genc -pl 100'`) instead of the traditional `git commit` command. This way, you can take advantage of the AI-powered commit message generation that Localite offers!
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin <branch_name>`).
5. Create a pull request.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! 👩‍💻🚀
